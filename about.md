### Hello world! 

My name is Cristian Gutu and I am a **Software Engineer** on **Prudentialâ€™s Messaging Team**.

Primarily I work on designing and implementing data pipelines supporting the flow of millions of events between producer and consumer systems across the organization. By leveraging a micro-services based pub-sub architecture, each pipeline is designed to move away from traditional monolithic point-to-point integrations to a more resilient microservices based event streaming pattern enabling real-time analytics, event based notifications, and data feed subscriptions.

I have experience with **Java**, **Python**, **Apache Kafka**, **Angular 13**, **Docker**, **Jenkins** and **Amazon Web Services** (AWS).

### Skills & Certifications

**Back-end:** Java, Python

**Front-end:** Angular 13, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

**Big Data and Stream Processing:** Apache Kafka, Kafka Streams, Apache Avro

**Data:** SQL, NoSQL (MySQL, DynamoDB)

**Technologies:** AWS, Spring Boot, Docker

**Certifications:** AWS Certified Developer (DVA-CO1)
