Hello world! My name is Cristian Gutu and I am recent Computer Science graduate from the __University of Connecticut__. I am interested in full stack development, DevOps, AWS, distributed systems, and machine learning with internship experience in all of these areas. Primarily I work with __Python__, __Node.js__, and __JavaScript__, but I've also had exposure to __C__, __Java__, and __C++__ in an academic setting. Technology wise, I have experience with __React.js__, __Docker__, __Jenkins__, __GitHub__, __BitBucket__, and __AWS__ (AWS Lambda, Redshift, DynamoDB, S3, API Gateway).
