Hello world! 

My name is Cristian Gutu and I am recent Computer Science graduate from the __University of Connecticut__. 

Currently I work as a Software Engineer on Prudentialâ€™s Platform Integrations Team.

I am primarily responsible for designing and implementing strategic, high-performance data pipelines supporting the flow of millions of records between producer and consumer systems across the organization. By leveraging a micro-services based pub-sub architecture, each pipeline is designed to move away from traditional monolithic point-to-point integrations to a more resilient micro-services based event streaming pattern enabling real-time analytics, event based notifications, and data feed subscriptions.

I am interested in full stack development, DevOps, AWS, and distributed systems -- with work experience in all of these areas. 

Primarily I work with __Java__, __Python__, __Node.js__, and __JavaScript__, but I've also had exposure to __C__ and __C++__ in an academic setting. 

Technology wise, I have experience with __Kafka__, __Angular 9__, __Vue__, __React.js__, __Docker__, __Jenkins__, __GitHub__, __BitBucket__, and __AWS__ (ECS, EC2, CloudWatch, Lambda, Redshift, DynamoDB, S3, API Gateway, CloudFormation, Route 53, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy).
