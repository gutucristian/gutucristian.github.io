Hey there, my name is Cristian Gutu and I am a junior at the University of Connecticut majoring in Computer Science. Currently, I am a teaching assistant for a systems programming class. In my free time I enjoy learning more about C programming, algorithms, and data structures! I also enjoy skate skiing in the winter, running in the summer, and calisthenics all year round :)
