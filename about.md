Hey there, my name is Cristian Gutu and I am a senior at the University of Connecticut majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. I am largely interested in full stack development, DevOps, and machine learning with internship experience in all of these areas. Primarily I work with Python, Node.js, and JavaScript, but I've also had exposure to C, Java, and C++ in an academic setting. Technology wise, I have experience with React.js, Docker, Jenkins, GitHub, BitBucket, and AWS (Lambda, Redshift, Dynamo, S3, API Gateway). I am further developing my experience with AWS as part of my senior design project with Lockheed Martin.
