`git` notes

#### Branch Management

`git branch -d <branch>` will delete local `<branch>`

`git push origin --delete bugfix` will delete the remote branch `bugfix` from the command line using a `git push` will also delete the local remote-tracking branch `origin/X` ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2003505/how-do-i-delete-a-git-branch-locally-and-remotely)).

#### Misc

`git push -u origin <branch>` will push `<branch>` to `origin` by creating a new branch on `origin` and setting local `<branch>` to track remote branch on `origin`

#### branch off of current branch

`git checkout -b <sub-branch> branch`

1. name of branch to be created: `api-cristian`
2. name of branch from which to branch off of: `api`

`git checkout -b api-cristian api`

#### add all modified files

`git add -u`

#### merge

to merge branch `foo` into `bar`:
1. `git checkout bar`
2. `git merge foo`
3. resolve conflicts if any

#### Tracking Branches

`git remote`: manage set of tracked repositories

`git remote show origin`: prints link that `origin` is an alias to

`git remote -v`: lists tracked repositories

`git remote rename origin booyah`: renames alias for tracked repository from `origin` to `booyah`

To make local `master` branch "track" remote `origin` (remember, `origin` is an alias to the remote): `git push -u origin master`

Note: `-u` option is the shortcut for the `--set-upstream` option (e.g., `git push --set-upstream origin master`)

#### Create a repository

__origin__: when you clone a repository for the first time `origin` is a default name given to the original remote repository that you clone, from where you want to `push` and `pull` changes. So basically `origin` is alias of your so big remote repository name. By saying `git push origin <branch_name>`, you are saying to push to the original repository.

__master__: `master` is the name of the default branch that git creates for you when first create a repository. In most cases, `master` means "the main branch”. It's the branch that represents production code, and that all other branches come from and generally eventually rejoin.

1. `git init`: creates an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one (basically a .git directory with subdirectories for `objects`, `refs/heads`, `refs/tags`, and `template` files. An initial `HEAD` file that references the `HEAD` of the `master` branch is also created)
2. `git add .`: adds all file contents to the "index" (the index holds a snapshot of the content of the working tree, and it is this snapshot that is taken as the contents of the next commit)
3. `git commit -m "first commit"`: create a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the given log message describing the changes. The new commit is a direct child of `HEAD`, usually the tip of the current branch, and the branch is updated to point to it 
4. `git remote add origin https://github.com/gutucristian/probable-robot.git`: creates a new remote called `origin` located at `https://github.com/gutucristian/probable-robot.git`. Once you do this, in your `push` and `pull` commands, you can use `origin` instead of typing out the whole URL
5. `git push -u origin master`: sets local `master` branch to "track" `origin` and pushes `master`'s working tree to remote defined by `origin`. (equivalent command: `git push --set-upstream origin master`)

Tracking branches are local branches that have a direct relationship to a remote branch. If you’re on a tracking branch and type git push, Git automatically knows which server and branch to push to. Also, running git pull while on one of these branches fetches all the remote references and then automatically merges in the corresponding remote branch [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4693588/what-is-a-tracking-branch).
