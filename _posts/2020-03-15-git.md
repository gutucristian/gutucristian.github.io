`git` notes

#### branch off of current branch

`git checkout -b <sub-branch> branch`

1. name of branch to be created: `api-cristian`
2. name of branch from which to branch off of: `api`

`git checkout -b api-cristian api`

#### add all modified files

`git add -u`

#### merge

to merge branch `foo` into `bar`:
1. `git checkout bar`
2. `git merge foo`
3. resolve conflicts if any

#### list tracked 

`git remote`: manage set of tracked repositories

`git remote show origin`: prints link that `origin` is an alias to

`git remote -v`: lists tracked repositories

`git remote rename origin booyah`: renames alias for tracked repository from `origin` to `booyah`

__origin__: when you clone a repository for the first time origin is a default name given to the original remote repository that you clone, from where you want to push and pull changes. So basically ‘origin’ is alias of your so big remote repository name. By saying git push origin <branch_name> , you are saying to push to the original repository.

__master__: master is the name of the default branch that git creates for you when first creating a repository . In most cases, "master" means "the main branch”. It's the branch that represents production code, and that all other branches come from and generally eventually rejoin.

To make local `master` branch "track" remote `origin` (remember, `origin` is an alias to the remote): `git push --set-upstream origin master`

Note: `-u` option is the shortcut for the `--set-upstream` option
