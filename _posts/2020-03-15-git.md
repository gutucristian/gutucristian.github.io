`git` notes

#### Branch Management

`git branch -d <branch>` will delete local `<branch>`

`git push origin --delete bugfix` will delete the remote branch `bugfix` from the command line using a `git push` will also delete the local remote-tracking branch `origin/X` ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2003505/how-do-i-delete-a-git-branch-locally-and-remotely)).

#### HEAD, Index, and Work tree 

The "working tree" refers to the files that you are currently working on.

Git index:
- The git "index" is where you place files you want commit to the git repository.

- The index is also known as cache, directory cache, current directory cache, staging area, staged files.

- Before you "commit" (checkin) files to the git repository, you need to first place the files in the git "index".

- The index is not the working directory: you can type a command such as `git status`, and git will tell you what files in your working directory have been added to the git index (for example, by using the git add filename command).

- The index is not the git repository: files in the git index are files that git would commit to the git repository if you used the git commit command.

The index is a staging area where the new commit is prepared. Essentially, the contents of the index are what will go into the new commit

`HEAD` is a pointer to the branch or commit that you last checked out, and which will be the parent of a new commit if you make it. For instance, if you're on the `master` branch, then `HEAD` will point to master, and when you commit, that new commit will be a descendent of the revision that master pointed to, and master will be updated to point to the new commit. If the branch commit history is a linked list, then `HEAD` would be the head of the linked list (where the head of the linked list is the latest commit).

#### Misc

`git push -u origin <branch>` will push `<branch>` to `origin` by creating a new branch on `origin` and setting local `<branch>` to track remote branch on `origin`

Interesting `git` implementation project: https://wyag.thb.lt/

Untrack files that have already been committed: `git rm --cached <file>`. This removes a file that is staged in the index (a single, large, binary file in `<baseOfRepo>/.git/index`, which lists all files in the current branch, their sha1 checksums, time stamps and the file name -- it is not another directory with a copy of files in it.)

Git lists same file in working tree (file modified) and in staging (not committed)?

This happens when you add a file to the index (`git commit <file>`) and then at some point edit the file again.

#### revert back to previous commit

`git reset [--soft | --mixed [-N] | --hard | --merge | --keep]`

**soft**

When using `git reset --soft HEAD~1` you will remove the last commit from the current branch, but the file changes will **stay in your working tree**. Also the changes will **stay on your index**, so following with a `git commit` will create a commit with the exact same changes as the commit you "removed" before.

**mixed**

This is **the default mode** and quite similar to soft. When "removing" a commit with `git reset HEAD~1` you will still **keep the changes in your working tree but not on the index**; so if you want to "redo" the commit, you will have to add the changes (`git add`) before commiting.

**hard**

When using `git reset --hard HEAD~1` you will lose all uncommited changes in addition to the changes introduced in the last commit. The **changes won't stay in your working tree** so doing a git status command will tell you that you don't have any changes in your repository.

**keep**

#### branch off of current branch

`git checkout -b <sub-branch> branch`

1. name of branch to be created: `api-cristian`
2. name of branch from which to branch off of: `api`

`git checkout -b api-cristian api`

#### add all modified files

`git add -u`

#### merge

to merge branch `foo` into `bar`:
1. `git checkout bar`
2. `git merge foo`
3. resolve conflicts if any

#### Tracking Branches

`git remote`: manage set of tracked repositories

`git remote show origin`: prints link that `origin` is an alias to

`git remote -v`: lists tracked repositories

`git remote rename origin booyah`: renames alias for tracked repository from `origin` to `booyah`

To make local `master` branch "track" remote `origin` (remember, `origin` is an alias to the remote): `git push -u origin master`

Note: `-u` option is the shortcut for the `--set-upstream` option (e.g., `git push --set-upstream origin master`)

#### Create a repository

__origin__: when you clone a repository for the first time `origin` is a default name given to the original remote repository that you clone, from where you want to `push` and `pull` changes. So basically `origin` is alias of your so big remote repository name. By saying `git push origin <branch_name>`, you are saying to push to the original repository.

__master__: `master` is the name of the default branch that git creates for you when first create a repository. In most cases, `master` means "the main branch”. It's the branch that represents production code, and that all other branches come from and generally eventually rejoin.

1. `git init`: creates an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one (basically a .git directory with subdirectories for `objects`, `refs/heads`, `refs/tags`, and `template` files. An initial `HEAD` file that references the `HEAD` of the `master` branch is also created)
2. `git add .`: adds all file contents to the "index" (the index holds a snapshot of the content of the working tree, and it is this snapshot that is taken as the contents of the next commit)
3. `git commit -m "first commit"`: create a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the given log message describing the changes. The new commit is a direct child of `HEAD`, usually the tip of the current branch, and the branch is updated to point to it 
4. `git remote add origin https://github.com/gutucristian/probable-robot.git`: creates a new remote called `origin` located at `https://github.com/gutucristian/probable-robot.git`. Once you do this, in your `push` and `pull` commands, you can use `origin` instead of typing out the whole URL
5. `git push -u origin master`: sets local `master` branch to "track" `origin` and pushes `master`'s working tree to remote defined by `origin`. (equivalent command: `git push --set-upstream origin master`)

Tracking branches are local branches that have a direct relationship to a remote branch. If you’re on a tracking branch and type git push, Git automatically knows which server and branch to push to. Also, running git pull while on one of these branches fetches all the remote references and then automatically merges in the corresponding remote branch [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4693588/what-is-a-tracking-branch).
