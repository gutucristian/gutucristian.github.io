My vim dotfile notes! Below are options and commands I personally found useful through experience. Of course, this list is only getting started and will constantly be updated as time goes on.

Use `set tabstop = 2` to set tabs to 2 spaces.

Use `set shiftwidth=2` to set shift width or indent amount to 2 spaces.

**To indent/un-indent code bock:** first select your desired code block using `Shift-V`. This activates visual mode and selects entire line(s). Use `Up` or `Down` arrow to make you selection and then type `Shift->` (that is `Shift` followed by `>`) to indent and `Shift-<` to unindent code block.

**To comment code block:** first type `Ctrl-V` to select area. Next, type `Shift-I` to insert character(s) and type `//` then hit `Esc`.

**To un-comment selection:** Type `Ctrl-V` to select area then type `d` to delete selected area.

`:retab` to retab tabs according to `tabstop` and `shiftwidth` rules.

`:nohl` to turn off highlight (usually after you are done searching for some pattern)

`/some_string` to search for some pattern (use `n` to go to next occurence)

Type `cw` to change current word.

# Linux commands

Linux `find` command looks for a file in some directory. For example: `find "." -name "callno.h"`: will look for file named `callno.h` in current directory and all subdirectories of current directory.

Linux `grep` command searches for string pattern in file(s). For example: `grep -rnw "." -name "thread_exit"` will recursively `-r` search for all occurences of pattern match in directory `.` (current directory). Because we passed the `-r` flag, the search space includes all subdirectories of this directory. Ultimately, running this command will search for the use of `"thread_exit"` and print line number(s) `-n` of said occurence(s). Importantly, it will make sure that entire pattern matches as given by the use of `-w`.

GNU `tar` is an archiving program designed to store multiple files in a single file (an archive) and to manipulate such files. File compression tools (like gzip and bzip2) compress single files (not groups of files). So, we use `tar` to group files into one monolithic file and then use a file compression tool like `gzip` to compress the file and save memory. In Windows, this is equivalent to `WinRAR` and `WinZip`. Read more [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/295860/why-do-people-use-tarballs).

To unpack a tarball:

`tar -zxvf filename`

To make a new tarball `fred.tar.gz` from a directory `fred`:

`tar -zcvf fred.tar.gz fred`

`tar` option parameter meanings:

- **c**	 create an archive
- **f**  filename	the name of the archive file
- **v**	 verbose: tell me what's going on
- **x**	 extract from an archive
- **z**	 put the archive through gzip
