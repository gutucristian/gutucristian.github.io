A collection of notes covering information on core Computer Science algorithms and data structures as well as relevant practice problems highlighting these topics.

## Graphs

The two main graph representations we use when talking about graph problems are the **adjacency list** and **adjancency matrix** approaches.

### Adjacency List

- An adjacency list is a list of lists
- Each list corresponds to a node `u` (i.e., vertex) on the graph and contains all the edges `(u, v)` that originate from the node `u`
- Thus, an adjacency list takes up `O(V + E)` space
- In Python, we can represent an adjacency list as a dictionary. The dictionaryâ€™s **keys will be the nodes**, and their **values will be the edges for each node**
- With the help of an adjacency list, we can find all the neighbours for a particular node in constant time (the quick lookup is due to the hashing mechanism of dictionaries)
