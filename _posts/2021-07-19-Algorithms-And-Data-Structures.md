This guide is a collection of my notes on fundamental algorithms and data structures in computer science.

## Dynamic Programming

Many dynamic programming problems can be solved using the following sequence:

1. Find a recursive relation

2. Recursive (top-down)

3. Recursive + memo (top-down)

4. Iterative + memo (bottom-up)

5. Iterative + `N` variables (bottom-up)

**Step 1:** figure out a recursive relation to
