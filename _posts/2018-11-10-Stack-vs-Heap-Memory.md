title: Stack vs. Heap Memory (and more)
---

In this fabulous post, I will explain stack vs. heap memory and more!! So, I suggest you grab some hot chocolat and learn a thing or two or three (or more). Anyways, let's get to the point homeboy.

But... before we get into the meat and potatos of this post (or tofu and potaoes if you vegan :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) we shall mention the various types of memory and how they are organized.
