An issue I ran into when using IntelliJ IDEA is not being able to view Java source code, declarations, and Javadocs. This can be resolved by going to your `src` folder (i.e., where your source code is located). Right click, navigate and toggle: __Mark Directory As > Sources Root__ ([link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37282285/intellij-cannot-find-any-declarations])).

__What is `transient` keyword?__

The `transient` keyword in Java is used to indicate that a field should not be part of the serialization. A `transient` variable is not part of the persistent state of an object. For example, if you have fields that are derived from other fields (programatically) then we can mark them as `transient` to prevent their state from being persisted during serialization. This helps save memory and increases speed of serialization / deserialization process. Say we have a `GalleryImage` class that `implements Serializable`. Among other instance variables / methods, assume this class contains two instance variables: `image` and `thumbnailImage`. The `thumbnailImage` is derived from the gallery `image`. Upon deserialization, the `readObject` method is called to perform any operations necessary to restore the state of the object. In this example, the `thumbnailImage` needs to be regenerated. Thus, we override the `readObject` method do that the thumbnail will be generated by calling a `generateThumbnail` method ([link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/910374/why-does-java-have-transient-fields)).

#### Composition 
Describes "has a" relationship

#### Inheritance 
Describes "is a" relationship

#### Advatages of composition over inheritance

1. Java does not support multiple inheritance. For reading and writing you can compose your class with `Reader` and `Writer`. You cannot implement more than one interface.

2. Easier testing. You can easily create a mock object and inject that as a dependency to test vs. having to implement and inherit super class.

3. Inheritance provides "tight coupling." If parent changes, child may break (e.g., removal of class in parent that is used in child).

4. Flexibility. For example, `Comparator` can be passed to `Collections.sort()` for custom sorting behaviour. This is convenient if you want to provide sorting behaviour other than default ([see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAp4GYprVHM)).
