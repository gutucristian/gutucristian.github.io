In this post, I will go over the language of the computer! To proceed with our analogy, the words of a computer's language are called _instructions_ and its vocabulary is called the **instruction set**. So:

**instuction set**: the vocabulary of commands understood by a given architechture

In this post (and all subsequent posts relating this topic) I will focus on the instruction set provided by MIPS Technologies (designed since the 1980s). But, sweat no more, this instrucion set is very similar and just as relevant as other popular instruction sets like ARMv7, Intel x86, and ARMv8 (which extends the address size of ARMv7 from 32 bits to 64 bits).

Why are they all similar you ask? Good question! It is because:

1. all computers are constucted from hardware that is based on similar underlying principles and,
2. there are basic operations that all computers must provide

Another vocabulary word I wanted to include is the **stored program concepts**: the idea that instructions and data of many types can be stored in memory as numbers!

More coming soon... (too many exams, so I don't have time to post all my notes).
