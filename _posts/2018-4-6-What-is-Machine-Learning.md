title: What is Machine Learning
---

Generally, two definitions of machine learning are offered. 

Arthur Samuel described machine learning as: 

>"the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed" 

This is an older, informal definition. Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: 

>"A computer program is said to learn from experience **E** with respect to some class of tasks **T** and performance measure **P**, if its performance at tasks in **T**, as measured by **P**, improves with experience **E**."

For example, consider a checkers game.

**E** = the experience of playing many games of checkers

**T** = the task of playing checkers

**P** = the probability that the program will win the next game

There are many types of machine learning algorithms. In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:
1. supervised learning
2. unsupervised learning
