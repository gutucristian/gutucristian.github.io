An issue I ran into when using IntelliJ IDEA is not being able to view Java source code, declarations, and Javadocs. This can be resolved by going to your `src` folder (i.e., where your source code is located). Right click, navigate and toggle: __Mark Directory As > Sources Root__ ([link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37282285/intellij-cannot-find-any-declarations])).

__What is `transient` keyword?__

The `transient` keyword in Java is used to indicate that a field should not be part of the serialization. A `transient` variable is not part of the persistent state of an object. For example, if you have fields that are derived from other fields (programatically) then we can mark them as `transient` to prevent their state from being persisted during serialization. This helps save memory and increases speed of serialization / deserialization process. Say we have a `GalleryImage` class that `implements Serializable`. Among other instance variables / methods, assume this class contains two instance variables: `image` and `thumbnailImage`. The `thumbnailImage` is derived from the gallery `image`. Upon deserialization, the `readObject` method is called to perform any operations necessary to restore the state of the object. In this example, the `thumbnailImage` needs to be regenerated. Thus, we override the `readObject` method do that the thumbnail will be generated by calling a `generateThumbnail` method ([link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/910374/why-does-java-have-transient-fields)).
